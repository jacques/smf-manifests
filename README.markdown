SMF Manifests
=============

SMF Manifests for use with Joyent SmartMachines (formerly Joyent Accelerators)
and can be used with other OpenSolaris Zones.  Tested on my personal
Joyent SmartMachine running snv_62, and snv_121.  I also use these on SmartOS
based SmartMachines (zones). YMMV.

Manifests exist for:

 * Confluence
 * Crowd
 * Exim
 * ISC dhcpd
 * JIRA
 * Nagios
 * OpenLDAP Server
 * PowerDNS
 * Spam Assassin
 * Sun DSEE
